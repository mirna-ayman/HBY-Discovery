            <h3>Eclipse Megamovie</h3>
            <p>Returning for the April 2024 total solar eclipse to study the sun’s atmosphere (the corona) in white light to better understand the density of the changing plasma in the sun’s atmosphere.

              The EM2024, funded by NASA, team welcomes you!If you have a DSLR camera and a tripod, you can participate! To learn more about the history of the Eclipse Megamovie project, solar eclipses, and how you can contribute to real scientific research of the sun, scroll down.</p>

            <p>Radio JOVE students and amateur scientists from around the world observe and analyze natural radio emissions of Jupiter, the Sun, and our galaxy using their own easy to construct radio telescopes.

              What's New: Radio JOVE announces a 2023 and 2024 solar eclipse observing campaign. In support of NASA Citizen Science and in partnership with the Heliophysics Big Year, Radio JOVE wants your help to study the Sun.</p>

            <h3>Solar Jet Hunter</h3>
            <p>The Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) has spent more than a decade collecting data from the Sun. One of the Sun's most enigmatic behaviors is its bursts of energy, which can take the form of jetted material like water spewing from a hose. In order to understand how the Sun forms jets, we need to examine the SDO data to figure out when and where the solar jets occurred on the Sun.</p>

            <h3>Exoplanet Watch</h3>
            <p>When you look up into the night sky, do you wonder what's out there beyond our solar system? So do we! Come join us in learning more about exoplanets, the worlds that orbit distant stars.

              You don't have to be a rocket scientist or an astrophysicist to actively participate in studying distant worlds. We’ll teach you what you need to know to become a citizen scientist collecting important data on exoplanets. No telescope? No problem! You can use our data checkout system to request data from an exoplanet observation to analyze yourself.</p>

            <h3>Solar Active Region Spotter</h3>
            <p>Our closest star is an enormous ball of hot plasma and tangled magnetic fields. Sometimes, knots of these fields erupt through the surface, becoming structures we call "active regions". These regions are compact and often very complex, and are frequently the sources of events like solar flares and coronal mass ejections. Their prevalence and periodic nature are also part of how we define the 11-year solar cycle.</p>

            <h3>Heliophysics Audified: Resonances in Plasmas</h3>
            <p>We invite you to join the HARP Citizen Science team and engage in cutting edge research of real satellite data! Use our open-source tool to reveal the hidden depths and structure of space, much like sonar is used to probe the deep ocean.

              We need your help to explore the data, there is too much for us to do alone. By converting this data into sound and listening with your ears, the brain can pick out complex wave patterns much faster than by eye.</p>
